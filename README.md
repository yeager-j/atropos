Website for Atropos 

## What is this?
This is the website for Atropos - a packet manipulation software. It uses the MEAN Stack and Passport for authentication.

## What challenges did you face?
As this is a live website where people will be buying things, I needed to make the authentication as secure as possible. I decided on Passport's local strategy and JWT.io's tokens.
